# ADW Workflow Extraction

Extract ADW workflow information from the text below and return a JSON response.

## Instructions

- Look for ADW workflow instructions in text ("Provide a plan", "Implement a plan", "Plan and implement" or similar)
- Look for ADW IDs (8-character alphanumeric strings, often after "adw_id:" or "ADW ID:" or similar)
- Return a JSON object with the extracted information
- If no ADW workflow is found, return empty JSON: `{}`

## Valid ADW Commands

- `/adw_plan` - Planning only
- `/adw_build` - Building only (requires adw_id)
- `/adw_plan_build` - Plan + Build

## Response Format

Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this format:
```json
{
  "adw_slash_command": "/adw_plan",
  "adw_id": "abc12345"
}
```

Fields:
- `adw_slash_command`: The ADW command found (include the slash)
- `adw_id`: The 8-character ADW ID if found

If only one field is found, include only that field.
If nothing is found, return: `{}`
